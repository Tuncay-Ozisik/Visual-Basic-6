This is a demonstration example how to interact VB6 and IDL (Interactive Data Language) in order to calculate some astronomical events.

Please note that;

- IDL must be installed already, Ver 4.0 or higher.
- Windows --> Control Panel / International Settings / Regional Settings --> Select "English (US)".
- Requires ASTRON library in IDL "lib" directory.
- Tested with Norhern Hemisphere and East Longitudes.
- No high precision for the times of events.
- "ephemeris.ini" file must be set according to location where ephemeris calculations needed.

Enjoy!
